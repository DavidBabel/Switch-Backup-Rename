# Switch-Backup-Rename

Easy way to rename your switch backups.
Just put the program in the same directory of your backups, and launch it.

By convention, backups have name like "serial".xci. And add it to the root of your SD card can be annoying.

This app fetch an online database and rename the xci file with the name followed by the serial, alowing system search for both and alphabetical sorting.
