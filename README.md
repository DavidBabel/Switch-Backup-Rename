# Switch-Backup-Rename

Easy way to rename your switch backups.

By convension, backups have name like "serial".xci. And add it to the root of your SD card can be annoying.

For now, this app fetch an online database and add a .txt file with more infos in the same directory as the xci files.

**Note:** that i did it to my personnal usage. It will be maintained only if users like it.
